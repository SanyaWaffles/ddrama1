/* *****
The year 2017 has arrived.

A herd of fuckin' ugly despair riddled cultists are rushing from the shadows.
Terrorism skyrocketed! Tchpsor is ruined!

Therefore, the Boredomdian government's only hope "Sanya Waffles" for the ousting of the Desperados.

Sanya is a killer queen. So powerful she has the power and anger of four Joyce Browns.

However, Sanya does not know there was a secret plan in progress!

Junko Enoshima plans to turn Tchpsor's TV transmitter into an ultimate weapon!
